# ECRP Base
The base set of resources for the East Coast Roleplay Server. üö∂‚Äç

This set is intended for testers and developers working as part of the ECRP Team. But feel free to contribute or get in touch if you want to join the team.


# This server requires **gamebuild 2189 (Cayo Perico) or higher**, as there are DLC dependencies.

You can join the [ECRP Discord](https://discord.gg/jA4z4er4Ad) and chat to the **team** about ideas, bugs and praising the good work!

This is by all means a **"work in progress"** base, and our first launched city, so be nice!

If you would like to get involved please drop into the discurd and say hi.

# Installation ‚öôÔ∏è:

Read ALL steps BEFORE following them. Do not assume or skip any step.

Install Xampp and start the mysql server

Ensure you have opened the port listed in the control panel (3306 by default)

Create a new directory (for example C:\FXServer\server), this will be used for the server binaries.

Download the current recommended master branch build for Windows from the Windows server build listing.
  https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/

Extract the build into the directory previously created.

Use any third-party archiving tool (such as WinRAR or 7-Zip) to open the .7z file.

Download The 'Base' folder and contents from here.

Load the included sql file into your database.

Create yourself a license key here - https://keymaster.fivem.net/ 

Edit the server.cfg file and add the license key and ensure the database name is correct.

Run the fxserver.exe to launch the server install process

When it asks what type of install you want, selet local files and point it to the Base folder where server.cfg is stored

# Critical Points :

The photo system in the phone will not work and you'll get stuck if you open it. So dont do that..
Housing, Heist, and a few other paid for resources that are seen on the server are not included here. For obvious leaking reasons!
