# ECRP Base
The base set of resources for the East Coast Roleplay Server. üö∂‚Äç

This set is intended for testers and developers working as part of the ECRP Team. But feel free to contribute or get in touch if you want to join the team.

# This server requires **gamebuild 2189 (Cayo Perico) or higher**, as there are DLC dependencies.

You can join the [ECRP Discord](https://discord.gg/jA4z4er4Ad) and chat to the **team** about ideas, bugs and praising the good work!

This is by all means a **"work in progress"** base, and our first launched city, so be nice!

If you would like to get involved please drop into the discurd and say hi.

### Requirements
* Time

* Windows(Preferably a VPS/Dedi)
  * You can use your desktop as well, But I would recommend hosting with a VPS or Dedi
  * Speak to us about recommended servers

* Common Sense
  * If you don't have this, then we're sorry, but we cannot help you past this.

* Patience
  * Creating a server requires A TON of patience, and if you don't have patience, you will get very angry, very fast. So step away from the machine now.

* Basic Lua/HTML/Css Knowledge is a plus.
  * I know this sounds like a job description, but It is always recommended to read up and practice these base languages before creating a server.

* Recommended Programs:
  * [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
  * [HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/download.php)
  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Or another Editing software


# Installation ‚öôÔ∏è:

Read ALL steps BEFORE following them. Do not assume or skip any step.

- 1 ) Install Xampp and start the mysql server (if you see red text its not worked!)
- 2 ) Ensure you have opened the port listed in the control panel (3306 by default)
- 3) Create a new directory (for example C:\FXServer\server), this will be used for the server binaries.
- 4) Download the current server files - Recommended master branch build for Windows from the Windows server build listing.
  https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/
- 5) Extract the build into the directory previously created.
- 6) Use any third-party archiving tool (such as WinRAR or 7-Zip) to open the .7z file.
- 7) Download The 'Base' folder and contents from here.
- 8) Load the included sql file (Base/DBfirstload.sql) into your database.
- 9) Create yourself a serverlicense key here - https://keymaster.fivem.net/ (keep it handy!)
- 10) Edit the server.cfg file and add the license key and ensure the database name is correct.
- 11) Run the C:\FXSERVER\server\fxserver.exe to launch the server install process
- 12) When it asks what type of install you want, selet local files and point it to the Base folder where server.cfg is stored
- 13) click next a few times and watch the console menu the first time the server starts
- 14) when its finished, click restart and it should not have any errors

# Critical Points :

The photo system in the phone will not work and you'll get stuck if you open it. So dont do that..
Housing, Heist, and a few other paid for resources that are seen on the server are not included here. For obvious leaking reasons!
