# dx_hud

This started as a fork of Cosmo HUD but ended up being a complete rewrite.  
dx_hud is an HUD for FiveM and ESX Legacy.

## Requirements

- es_extended (Legacy)
- esx_status
- esx_basicneeds

## Optionals

- pma-voice

## Useful Snippets

### I won't provide any support for the snippets below, it's up to you to understand if you need it or not or if you have any conflicts aswell.

If you want to equal health among peds, run this client-side every tick.
```lua
if GetEntityMaxHealth(PlayerPedId()) ~= 200 then
  SetEntityMaxHealth(PlayerPedId(), 200)
  SetEntityHealth(PlayerPedId(), 200)
end
```

If you want to disable health regen, run this client-side every tick.
```lua
  SetPlayerHealthRechargeMultiplier(PlayerId(), 0.0) 
  SetPlayerHealthRechargeLimit(PlayerId(), 0.0)
```
